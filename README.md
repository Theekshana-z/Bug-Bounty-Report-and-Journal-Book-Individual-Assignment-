# Bug Bounty Report and Journal Book – Individual Assignment

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my submission for the **2nd Year, 2nd Semester** Individual Assignment for the **Web Security (WS)** module at SLIIT. The project focuses on participating in a bug bounty program, identifying vulnerabilities, and documenting the findings in a structured manner.

## 🧩 Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

* `WS Assignment Final Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the bug bounty findings, including identified vulnerabilities, their impact, and recommended mitigations.
* `Journal Book.pdf`: A journal documenting the process, tools used, challenges faced, and lessons learned during the bug bounty engagement.

## 🔐 About Bug Bounty Programs

Bug bounty programs are initiatives where organizations invite ethical hackers and security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities in their systems. In return, they offer rewards based on the severity and impact of the findings. Participating in such programs enhances practical knowledge of real-world security issues and contributes to improving overall cybersecurity.

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques Used

To identify and document vulnerabilities, I employed various tools and techniques, including:

* **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and analyzing HTTP requests.
* **OWASP ZAP**: For automated security scanning and vulnerability detection.
* **Manual Testing**: Conducting thorough manual testing to identify complex vulnerabilities.
* **Markdown**: For documenting findings in a structured and readable format.

## 📄 Documentation

The `WS Assignment Final Report.pdf` provides a detailed analysis of the identified vulnerabilities, including:

* **Vulnerability Identification**: Descriptions of each discovered vulnerability.
* **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of the potential impact and likelihood.
* **Mitigation Strategies**: Recommended actions to address each vulnerability.

The `Journal Book.pdf` offers insights into the bug bounty process, including:

* **Engagement Overview**: An overview of the selected bug bounty program and its scope.
* **Methodology**: The approach and steps taken during the engagement.
* **Challenges Faced**: Obstacles encountered and how they were overcome.
* **Lessons Learned**: Key takeaways and knowledge gained from the experience.
